## title: "Time Series Forecasting App (Synthetic SKU Volume) -  (SARIMA, LSTM, TFT, N-BEATS, PatchTST) on synthetic SKU/FC data."

---

## 🧭 What This Project Is

A mock yet realistic **SKU-level inbound/outbound volume forecasting pipeline** for a fulfillment center network. It is built to:

- Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow for time-series forecasting
- Serve as an interview artifact / portfolio project
- Provide a playground for experimenting with multiple model families

The data is **synthetic** and mimics real operational signals (calendar effects, weather, carrier delays, orders, inventory, etc.).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Forecast per **(center\_id, sku\_id)** daily volumes to support:

- Labor & staffing plans
- Dock/truck scheduling
- Inventory replenishment & SKU allocation
- Exception monitoring (spikes, stockouts)

## 🗂️ Data Sources (Synthetic CSVs)

| File                     | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `volume_log.csv`         | Daily inbound/outbound volume by center & SKU  |
| `calendar.csv`           | Weekend, holiday, promo flags                  |
| `product_catalog.csv`    | SKU category, storage type, size               |
| `weather.csv`            | Temperature & alert flags per center           |
| `carrier_tracking.csv`   | ETA vs actual arrival, delay minutes           |
| `order_feed_stream.csv`  | Recent order quantities (near-real-time proxy) |
| `inventory_snapshot.csv` | On-hand qty, reorder point, lead time          |

## 🧮 Feature Engineering

- **Lags:** 1D, 7D, 14D
- **Rolling stats:** 7D mean, 14D std
- **Calendar:** weekday, month, holiday/promo flags
- **Weather:** temp, severe\_alert flag
- **Orders/Carrier:** last 24h orders, delay minutes, late flag
- **Inventory:** available units, stockout risk, lead time

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

**Classical / Statistical**

- SARIMAX (statsmodels)

**Machine Learning / Gradient Boosting**

- (Planned) XGBoost / LightGBM baseline over engineered features

**Deep Learning (PyTorch)**

- LSTM (hand-rolled Keras or PyTorch version depending on branch)
- Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) via PyTorch Forecasting
- N-BEATS via PyTorch Forecasting
- PatchTST (Hugging Face `transformers` implementation)

> The app allows selecting model/horizon, training, viewing metrics (MAE, RMSE, WAPE/SMAPE), and visualizing forecasts with intervals.

---

## 🧪 Metrics

- **MAE**, **RMSE**, **WAPE/SMAPE** for comparability
- Rolling backtests / time-based CV splits coming soon

---

## 🖥 App Features

- Parameter selection per model (orders for SARIMA, input/forecast window for DL models, etc.)
- Interactive plots (actual vs forecast, residuals) - under development
- Downloadable forecast results - - under development
- Caching for faster experimentation

---

## 🚀 Quickstart (Local)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Gee1225/ts_synthetic.git
cd ts_synthetic

# 2. (Optional) pin Python
pyenv local 3.10.14  # or use conda/venv

# 3. Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run
streamlit run Forecasting_app.py
```

### Runtime & Requirements

- **Python**: pinned via `runtime.txt` (e.g., `3.10.14` for Streamlit Cloud)
- **requirements.txt** excludes `tensorflow-macos` / `tensorflow-metal` for Linux builds. If TF is needed locally on Mac, use a dev-only `requirements_macos.txt`.

---

## 🌩 Deployment Notes (Streamlit Cloud)

- Place `runtime.txt` (single line with Python version) in repo root
- Keep `requirements.txt` minimal and Linux-friendly (no `tensorflow-macos`)
- Clear cache after dependency changes

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

- ✅ PatchTST integration & config fixes
- ✅ TFT/N-BEATS support via PyTorch Forecasting
- ⭕ Time-based cross-validation UI
- ⭕ Hyperparameter search (Optuna/Weights & Biases)
- ⭕ Probabilistic forecasts / quantiles
- ⭕ MLflow experiment tracking
- ⭕ Real-time data ingestion (Kafka/APIs)
- ⭕ Multi-horizon forecasting dashboards
